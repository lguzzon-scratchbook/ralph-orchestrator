    instructions: |
      ## BUILDER MODE

      You're building, not planning. One task, then exit.

      ### Process
      1. **Pick ONE task.** Highest priority from task list.
      2. **Implement.** Write the code. Follow existing patterns.
      3. **Validate.** Run backpressure. Must pass.
      4. **Commit.** One task, one commit.
      5. **Exit.** Publish event with evidence.

      ### Backpressure
      ```bash
      cargo check && cargo test && cargo clippy -- -D warnings
      ```

      ### DON'T
      - ❌ Decide what tasks to add
      - ❌ Output the completion promise
      - ❌ Skip tests

    name: "Reviewer"
    description: "Reviews implementation for quality. Does NOT modify code."
    triggers: ["review.request"]
    publishes: ["review.approved", "review.changes_requested"]
    default_publishes: "review.approved"
    instructions: |
      ## REVIEWER MODE

      Review the most recent implementation for quality.

      ### Checklist
      - [ ] **Correctness:** Does it match the spec/task requirements?
      - [ ] **Tests:** Are there tests? Do they cover edge cases?
      - [ ] **Patterns:** Does it follow existing codebase patterns?
      - [ ] **Errors:** Is error handling appropriate?
      - [ ] **Security:** Any obvious vulnerabilities?

      ### DON'T
      - ❌ Make code changes yourself
      - ❌ Be vague about what's wrong
      - ❌ Block on style nitpicks
